Sign Language Translator Using CNN
A real-time application that captures hand gestures via webcam and translates them into corresponding text and speech outputs, facilitating communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.


üßæ Introduction
This project aims to develop a real-time Sign Language Translator that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand gestures captured via a webcam and translate them into corresponding text and speech outputs. The system is designed to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments by facilitating effective communication.

‚ùì Problem Statement
Individuals with hearing and speech impairments often rely on sign language as their primary mode of communication. However, the majority of the population lacks proficiency in sign language, leading to significant communication barriers in daily interactions. Traditional methods, such as human interpreters, are not always accessible or feasible in real-time scenarios. Existing technological solutions often lack accuracy, are not user-friendly, or fail to operate effectively in dynamic environments.

üéØ Objectives
Develop a real-time system to translate hand gestures into text and speech.

Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate gesture recognition.

Create a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Ensure high accuracy and efficiency in gesture recognition.

üåü Significance
Bridges communication gaps between sign language users and non-users.

Enhances accessibility for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.

Demonstrates the practical application of AI in assistive technologies.

Promotes inclusivity and equal opportunities in communication.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system comprises three main components:

Frontend: A graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the webcam feed with a designated area highlighting the region of interest (ROI) for gesture capture. It also shows the predicted character and provides options to hear the translated speech.

Backend: Handles data preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction. It processes the images to identify the gesture and outputs the corresponding text and speech.

Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of hand gestures representing alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).

üîÑ Workflow
The system operates through the following sequential steps:

Data Acquisition:

Capture hand gesture images using a webcam.

Focus on static gestures representing alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).

Data Preprocessing:

Convert images to grayscale.

Resize images to a uniform dimension (e.g., 64x64 pixels).

Normalize pixel values to the range [0,1].

Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping) to enhance dataset diversity.

Model Training:

Design a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.

Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.

Validate the model's performance using a separate validation set.

Real-Time Prediction:

Capture live video feed from the webcam.

Define a Region of Interest (ROI) where the user places their hand.

Process the ROI and feed it into the trained CNN model.

Display the predicted character on the GUI.

Convert the predicted text into speech using a text-to-speech engine.

User Interaction:

Provide controls to start/stop the webcam feed.

Allow users to clear the displayed text.

Enable speech output for the predicted text.
